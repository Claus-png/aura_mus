## About

**AURA** is a private Android music player built for people who want to listen to music without subscriptions or restrictions. The app lets you download tracks from Yandex Music, Spotify, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music directly to your device, manage a local library, create playlists, and fine-tune the sound with a built-in equalizer.

AURA is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and ExoPlayer.

## FAQ

**Why does Yandex Music only download 30 seconds?**  
You are not signed in, or the session has expired. Go to **Settings → Sign in to Yandex Music** and log in again.

**Why are "I Listen Often" and "Rarely Played" empty?**  
These playlists are built from listening stats. Make sure **"Track listening stats"** is enabled in Settings.

**Why won't Spotify / SoundCloud download?**  
These sources require a configured home server. Check the status in **Settings → Home Server**.

**Tracks don't appear in the library after downloading.**  
The download is likely still in progress. Open the **"Add Music"** tab and check the job status.

**How do I rename a smart playlist?**  
Long-press the playlist → **Rename**.
